	<h1>Brand Guidelines and Collateral Project</h1>

	<p>
		Collateral is a funny term. It has meanings in finance, geography, war, etc. But for what we are discussing we use the word to describe all of the different branded pieces that a company will need to operate as a business.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The importance of this in branding is that all of these pieces, when spread out on a table, should be able to stand alone, but more importantly should all be consistent in their design system and have a common visual style.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		To be a successful brand you need to remember what is core to your brand and use that as the place where you design and communicate from. Remember that you filled out the design brief for a reason. You know the history of your company, you know your target market. Keep these in mind as you are putting together your materials.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The visual style that you use to design and communicate from is that will drive your design choices. So make sure to carefully choose that style. Part of deciding how that style works is building brand standards manual. That manual will give not only you, but anyone that is working with your brand, the correct way to use your brand. Not only just how to use the logo, but what colors, fonts, images, and language to use when making pieces for your brand.
	</p>
