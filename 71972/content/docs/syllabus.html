			<h1>Evaluation</h1>

			<section class="instruction-methods">
				<h2>Instruction Methods</h2>
					<p>
	Lectures, Lectures, demonstrations, exercises and advanced projects. Learners will complete image-based projects using Adobe Creative Suite.
</p>			</section>
			
			<section class="evalutation-components">
				<h2>Evaluation Components</h2>
					<h3>Exercises</h3>

	<p>
		There will be <strong>2 exercises</strong> worth <strong>5 points each</strong>. Students will submit work files to the specified dropbox each week.
	</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>

	<p>
		Projects are longer term, in-depth, self-directed assignments used to explore and execute a non-academic design problem or series of problems. Significant research and development is required. To succeed, combine learned mechanics and principles, review and expand upon content and individual artistic expression.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		You will create your own artwork responding to your research and learned skills with creative freedom. An in-depth written self assessment reflecting on the process and presentation will be completed with each project.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		There are <strong>5 projects</strong> for this course worth <strong>10 points each</strong>. Each project will expand the student’s knowledge of an important aspect of Branding. Projects are graded on creativity, layout precision, and typography.
	</p>


<h3>Sketchbook</h3>

	<p>
		To make sure that you are sketching, creating prototypes, and thinking critically, a sketchbook is part of your final grade. You do not have to turn in the sketchbook, it is yours to keep, but when we discuss roughs in class, your sketchbook is where they should be. I will review your sketchbook multiple times through out the course, usually once per project. <strong>Sketchbook reviews are worth 5 points</strong>.
	</p>

<h3>Critiques</h3>

	<p>
		It is very important to learn how to present your work to a group of people. Professionally you will be presenting work to your peers or clients and seeking their feedback. It is important to learn how to receive that feedback, but also how to give feedback to others. We will present each project in class and critique as a class.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Critique is intended as a positive idea exchange, and is a part of the learning experience. All students are expected to participate to explain design concepts and comment on/ask questions about others work. Because we will be going through everyones project, being on time for class is required. <strong>Each critique is worth 3 point</strong>.
	</p>
	
	<br />
	
<hr class="line" />
	
<h2>Criteria</h2>
<p>
	<strong>This class is based on 100 points.</strong> There are 10 points for two exercises, 50 points for your projects, 25 points for your sketchbook, and 15 points for critiques.

			<h1>Additional Items</h1>
				<section class="netiquette">
	<h3>Etiquette</h3>

<p>
	Etiquette is commonly defined as a set of principles developed to express courtesy and help people communicate appropriately with one another. The Instructor and course participants alike will demonstrate etiquette and civility whenever interacting with each other. Please use standard “Business English” (complete sentences) and avoid jargon or slang when communicating.
</p>

<p>
	Consider anything said in public forums (Web-based applications explored in this course, our discussion forums, and when giving feedback to other participants) to be public information. Do not post/make comments that may be considered controversial, abrasive, in poor taste, or may reveal too much personal information - protect your privacy.
</p></section>

<section class="academic-honesty">
	<h2>Academic Honesty</h2>

<p>
	Academic integrity is essential to a positive teaching and learning environment. All students enrolled in College courses are expected to complete coursework responsibilities with fairness and honesty. Failure to do so by seeking unfair advantage over others or misrepresenting someone else’s work as your own can result in disciplinary action, as outlined in the College Academic Dishonesty Policy.
</p></section>

<section class="plagiarism">
	<h2>Plagiarism Policy</h2>
<p>
	Plagiarism is a cardinal subject in art. Fair use will be covered in some detail throughout the class. Failing to understand fair use — intentionally or not — can cost a creative company or individual millions of dollars. This is why LCC’s goal is to correct plagiarism and unfair use early on.
</p>

<p>
	Plagiarized assignments will be scored as zero with no chance to make up the assignment—whether the cause was malice or ignorance. You will lose all participation points for the day. In certain cases, particularly multiple offenses, it may be reported to the LCC Behavior Intervention Team.

<section class="labs">
	<h2>Computer Graphics Labs Policies</h2>

<section class="alert alert-warning" style="padding: 30px;">
	<p>
		<strong>Check in at GB 113</strong>, and give your validated LCC ID to the lab aide. At some times the staff may be in one of the labs solving a problem. Ring the bell, or seek the staff in one of the other rooms, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, or <b>116</b>. The staff will keep your ID until you check out.
	</p>
	
	<br />
	
	<p>
		The lab aide will check to see if you are on the list. You must sign a rules sheet upon entering the lab for the first time each semester.
	</p>
	
	<br />
	
	<p>
		The lab aide will assign you a seat and give you a card with the number of the station on it. That card is your proof you are in the lab legitimately. Stick it to the velcro square at the upper left corner of your monitor, where all can see it.
	</p>
</section>

<p class="alert alert-info">
	To check out a manual, or other resource material, fill out a check out slip.  These materials may not leave the lab at any time.
</p>

<p>
	<strong style="color: red;">THE LAB AIDES ARE NOT YOUR PERSONAL TUTORS</strong>. They may answer general questions, but they are there to look after the lab, not the users.
</p>

<h3>When the lab is crowded:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>No one will be forced to give up a computer who has not used it for at least an hour.</li>
	<li>The user who signed in earliest will be the first asked to leave.</li>
	<li>Anyone who leaves a computer for more than ten minutes may be considered finished, and the station may be assigned to the next user.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong style="color: red;">Lab aides are the final arbiter of how lab time will be distributed fairly.</strong></p>

<h3>Use of Printers</h3>

<p>
	Use of printers is limited to ONLY classwork for Art, Design and Multimedia classes which meet in the lab! Special projects may be okayed by your instructor, or the CG program coordinator. You MUST print a proof to a black and white printer and check it carefully before printing to a color printer. Color printers are for final copy ONLY--one color print per project, ever. If there is a problem, you must get permission to print again from your instructor or from the Lab Technicians.
</p>

<p>
	Users may not use papers brought in from outside the lab, except in special cases approved by the Lab Technician. If you discover a problem with any hardware or software, please report it to the lab aide or your instructor <b>AT ONCE</b>.
