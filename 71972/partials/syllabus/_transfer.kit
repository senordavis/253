	The Michigan Transfer Agreement (MTA) and the MACRAO Transfer Agreement simplify the transfer of students from one Michigan institution to another. MACRAO will be replaced by the MTA which is effective for students entering Fall 2014 or later.  Students who started prior to Fall 2014 will be able to complete the MACRAO Transfer Agreement through Summer 2019, or they may complete the MTA requirements.  The most current MTA information can be found at <a href="http://www.lcc.edu/transfer/mta.aspx">http://www.lcc.edu/transfer/mta.aspx</a> and the current MACRAO information is available at <a href="http://www.lcc.edu/transfer/macrao_agreement.aspx">http://www.lcc.edu/transfer/macrao_agreement.aspx</a>.
