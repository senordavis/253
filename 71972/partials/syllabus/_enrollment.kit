	Class attendance and participation are essential to student success. Class rosters will be updated by the end of the second week of the semester (50% refund period) to accurately reflect student enrollment in this course. <strong>Students who have not attended by the end of week two will be administratively dropped and responsible for any required tuition and fee charges.</strong>
