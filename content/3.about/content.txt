##Course Description

ARTS 253, Graphic Design Branding, is an advanced course involving effective design in branding and media marketing, the use of strategic planning for marketing campaigns and the creation of persuasive and promotional 2 and 3 dimensional design collateral. Exploring the de­sign­er’s role in large project organization is the focus. The class will explore integrated corporate identity pro­grams within media campaigns and includes contemporary design and multimedia techniques and tools.

Stu­dents will work through the entire design process from concept to final design as well as aspects of prepress production and client pre­sen­ta­tion. The emphasis of the course is on the stu­dent’s ability to evaluate the branding and marketing needs of design clients and come up with appropriate and innovative design solutions.

**Prerequisite: ARTS 251**

Concurrent enrollment in ARTS 252 is acceptable, but not recommended.


##Course Documents

LCC is a green college. In the endeavor to reduce the amount of paper used, most materials for this class will be distributed to you electronically. You will be able to ﬁnd all course documents on the class site.


##Course Participation
This course will be run very similar to how an actual design studio would run. There will be demos throughout the course to help you learn the software to be able to complete your assignments and projects. But more importantly the classroom will function like a studio, interact with your peers to get feedback. We will hold critiques for rough drafts and finished assignments and projects. You are required to participate in all critiques as it is part of your final grade.

##Critiques
Critique is intended as a positive idea exchange, and is a part of the learning experience. All students are expected to participate to explain design concepts and comment on/ask questions about other students’ work. Because of the teaching method, being on time for class is required. Class begins promptly at 10 minutes after the hour.

##Student Responsibilities
**Class attendance is mandatory**. If you must miss class due to illness or other circumstances, the instructor must be notified. If a student misses 3 or more sequential sessions without contact, they may be dropped.

Attendance and classroom participation in critiques contributes to grade. Students must have necessary course materials and should check this course outline or the class site prior to class each day.
Students in ARTS 253 should expect to spend a minimum of 2-4 hours per week outside of class preparing projects and completing assignments.

Lectures and demonstrations are only given once. If you need to help understanding the concept each lectures slides will be posted to the class site. All assignments and resources, if any will also be posted to the class site.

Attendance is critical in this advanced class; you will be using a time sheet to record time spent on all 253 projects. To be prepared for each class, please check this course syllabi or the class site before each class session.

If an absence is excused and the grade in question is something that can not be made up, i.e. classroom activity, the grade will be dropped, otherwise if the absence is not excused it will be graded as a zero.

Should a serious medical or personal emergency arise, or your work schedule changes, the instructor will work with you to initiate an administrative withdrawal which will not affect your overall GPA. This option is only available if you are in good standing in the class. If 80% or more of the class is complete and this occurs, you may be eligible for an administrative incomplete.

##Learning Outcomes
Based upon industry standards and professional practice, the student will be able to:

* Demonstrate problem solving utilizing the design process in a creative, logical, and meaningful manner that utilizes effective, cohesive design style culminating in an individual design and marketing campaign.

* Utilize design and marketing processes in the area of corporate identity and promotional graphics developed for professional prepress production output.

* Apply technical knowledge and specified workflow procedures to create electronic files for prepress production and mass printing.

* Identify professional practices within a design firm, advertising agency, or public relations firm regarding areas including employment responsibilities, client contact, design briefing and in-process reporting to a wide variety of commercial clients.

* Communicate and present a visual and verbal design proposal involving a formal presentation as an individual or as a member of a collaborative learning design team.

* Process, save and submit files for professional prepress output within an accepted standard process for the appropriate mass printing process.

##Evaluation
Projects are graded equally on:

1. Creativity / Application of design principles
2. Completing all project Requirements
3. Precision in layout skills in final design
4. Typographic accuracy, and
5. Presentation.

**Note: Resubmitting assignments is not possible in this class;** Projects must be completed in a timely manner. Late assignments will only be accepted on a case by case basis, otherwise no late assignments may be turned in.

**Class Attendance** – (5% of final grade)  
Your attendance to class is crucial to understanding the concepts and to have enough time to finish your assignments and projects.

**Class Participation** – (5% of final grade)  
Class participation is required. Primarily this refers to presentations, self assessments, online interaction, and participating in the group discussions and activities. This ties directly to attending every class session.

**Sketchbook** – (10% of final grade)  
To make sure that you are sketching, creating prototypes, and thinking critically a sketchbook with 50 sketches is part of your final grade. You do not have to turn in the sketchbook, it is yours to keep, but I will be coming around to periodically check to see that you are doing work in it.

**Assignments and Projects** – (80% of final grade)  
Applying design mechanics and/or principles to solve an academic design problem. Specific criteria and an evaluation rubric will be included for each assignment. A written self assessment reflecting on the process and in-class presentation will be completed with each assignment.

Longer term, in-depth, self-directed assignments used to explore and execute a non-academic design problem or series of problems. Significant research and development is required. To succeed, combine learned mechanics and principles, review and expand upon content and individual artistic expression. Project specific criteria and an evaluation rubric will be included in each project. You will create your own artwork responding to your research and learned skills with creative freedom. An in-depth written self assessment reflecting on the process and presentation will be completed with each project.

##Required Materials
You already own most of the supplies for this class. There are a few required items, but every single one is important to your success in the course.

* Cloud Storage
* Sketchbook / Notebook
* Drawing Tools – (pencils, sharpie, crayons, etc.)
* Time Sheet

<br />

###Cloud Storage
It is strongly recommended that you sign up for a cloud storage service. The computers at LCC are periodically wiped clean and operating systems reinstalled. For this reason you should never save anything to the computers you are working on. Instead you should save them to a cloud storage service.

You may already have an external hard drive or flash drive that you save things to, which is perfectly acceptable, but for this course I would like you to also have an online storage option for back up or primary use. There are many of these our there that offer free space for your use.

I recommend that you use Dropbox to save and store all your files. It is a service that when you install the software on the computer will sync your documents to that computer. It also allows access via the web and mobile apps to all of your stored files. But most importantly it keeps your files safe, backed up, and allows you to undelete a deleted file. If you don’t already have an account sign up by visiting: [mdavisdesign.com/dropbox](http://mdavisdesign.com/dropbox)

If you sign up with the above link, and you use your LCC or other .edu email address, you will receive an extra 500MB of storage space.

###Sketchbook / Notebook
It is a requirement that you have a sketchbook / notebook for use throughout the semester. You will be using it to come up with your initial ideas for all of your assignments. You may also use it for any other drawings that you would like to create as inspiration, or even research notes and ideas for your individual assignments and projects. Your sketchbook will be checked periodically through the class.

###Timesheet
To help you better understand how much time goes into putting together marketing materials you will be using time tracking software to help you keep track of your work. This will help you understand how long it take you to work on something so that you can allow yourself the proper time to work on your projects, but it will also help inform your process so that you know when you are working effectively or wasting time. This will be a great help for you once you go out into the real world to understand that in every design firm or agency time is extremely important.

We will be using [something](#) to do our time tracking and reports. You will be invited to share an account with the instructor and will have individual tasks assigned to you for each project.

###Communication
In order to suit not only individual student needs, but also class facilitation, I will be communicating with you in a variety of ways. Because the college no longer makes it easy for faculty to get information to contact students, and often the information that is provided is inaccurate, there will be a form you will be asked to fill out with updated contact information. This information will only be used by the instructor and will not be provided to anyone else.

Throughout the course I will also communicate with you via the following methods:

* Twitter
* Email
* Instant Messaging
* Class Website

####Twitter
Because this is a technology that is being used by many of the professionals in the field you are studying, I will be communicating with you a lot, both in class and out of class through twitter. Throughout the course we will be exploring both traditional and new forms of branding / marketing. To help us all stay connected, and because the messages are short and concise, twitter is a great way to keep in touch with me and your peers in class.

If you wish not to create a twitter account you may also find the updates about class by going to twitter.com and doing a search for the class hash tag #arts253 or by visiting the class site.
