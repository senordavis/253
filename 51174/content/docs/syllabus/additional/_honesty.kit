<h2>Academic Honesty</h2>

<p>
	Academic integrity is essential to a positive teaching and learning environment. All students enrolled in College courses are expected to complete coursework responsibilities with fairness and honesty. Failure to do so by seeking unfair advantage over others or misrepresenting someone elseâ€™s work as your own can result in disciplinary action, as outlined in the College Academic Dishonesty Policy.
